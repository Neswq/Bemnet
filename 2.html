<p>3D printing in construction offers a significant potential to increase efficiency in the building sector, including the 
following ways.<br><br>
Speed: 3D printing has already shown that it can build a home or building from the ground up in a matter of days.<br><br>
Waste reduction: 3D printing is an additive manufacturing process that only uses as much material as is necessary for creating a 
structure. When paired with other waste-reducing processes and building methods like prefabrication and lean construction, 
the potential of a waste-zero building seems all the more likely.<br><br>
Design freedom: Architects are able to build complex designs that are otherwise unattainable, or too expensive or labor-intensive
 to create by conventional construction means. This can allow for a lot more innovation and creativity in the commercial construction
space.<br><br>
Reduce human error: Because construction would be more programmable and automated, worker injuries and fatalities would 
likely decrease if 3D printing was incorporated onto the job site</p>
