<h1 id="story03">The Challenges of 3D printing in Construction<br><br></h1>
<p>
Despite the benefits and potential that 3D printing has in the construction sector, there are a number of factors that may prohibit the technology from becoming
mainstream.  <br>
High costs: 3D printers are costly, and that upfront purchase cost doesn’t include materials or maintenance. Right now, it’s difficult for many construction professionals to 
justify 3D printing’s cost over the technology’s benefits. <br>
Labor shortage: Construction labor shortages are already a problem, and finding qualified workers to employ in 3D printing construction environments could prove to be 
even more challenging in the future.<br>
Quality control: If not constantly monitored and overseen by real humans, quality in 3D printing could end up being a very expensive mess.
</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>There are plenty of benefits to using 3D printing in the construction industry and the companies using it already are very successful. 3D technologies help to manage the
whole production process, from the early stages of the project to produce it. Structures are being 3D printed at a fraction of the regular cost and time.
Overall, 3D printing is poised to be a viable solution that offers key benefits in cost savings and environmental friendliness for our building’s future.</p>
